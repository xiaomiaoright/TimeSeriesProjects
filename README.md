# About this repo
This repo includes 5 time series projects, from entry level visualization to high level machine learning time series projects. 

# Part 1: Numpy, Pandas, and Time Series Data
Background: Pandas was developed in the context of financial modeling, so it contains a fairly extensive set of tools for working with dates, times, and time-indexed data.

## Data and time data types:
* Time stamps 2020-07-01 12:00:00
* Time intervals and periods: length of time between a particular beginning and end point
* Time deltas or durations: extact length of time

In the following section, the project will show how to work with those date types in python.
